title: "Type-Safe GraphQL Apps With Typescript - Workshop"
hidden: true
tags: ["javascript", "typescript"]
duration: Half day
abstract: |
    In this workshop we’re going to look at how to bring type-safety to our GraphQL apps using TypeScript. For our server, we’ll look at how we can share types between the schema, resolvers and data access layer. Then we’ll take a look at how to share those types across to our client application (we’ll use React in the workshop).

    It'll be a hands on workshop, so be prepared to get ready to implement your own type safe JavaScript GraphQL application.

    **Talk Takeaways**

    At the end of the workshop, attendees should have an understanding of the options for creating type-safe GraphQL applications, and how to have that type-safety applied to the client and server components.

audience:
    - GraphQL developers
    - JavaScript developers

notes: |
    A VS Code Devcontainer (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) will be provided that contains all dependencies ready to go. If attendees are unable to use a VS Code Devcontainer, they will need to have
    * Node.js 12
    * An editor
    * Latest version of the Azure Function Core Tools (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#v2) to run the GraphQL server

    Some prior knowledge of TypeScript will be beneficial, but not required. An Azure account will be needed if they wish to deploy it at the end of the workshop.

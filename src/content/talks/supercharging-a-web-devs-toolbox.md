    Being a web developer can be a complex job, whether it's picking the right JavaScript framework, CSS framework, transpiling pipeline, bundler, linter, and this is before we even start talking about tooling.

    But let's talk about tooling, there's been a lot of exciting innovations in the last few years with the tools that we can use to make a web developers live easier. From VS Code extensions to real-time remote collaboration, dev environment setup to build automation, let's take a look at all of those.

    In this session we'll take a look at our toolbox and how we can make the most from it. We'll start with VS Code and some extensions to make web dev easier. Next we'll look at how to configure development environments for repeatability, so you spend less time installing software and more time building it. To cap it off we'll look at how to build and deploy applications with a push of a commit.

audience:
    - Web Developers
    - Hobbyists
    - Students

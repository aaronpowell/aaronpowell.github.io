In September I was invited to present at the [F# Sydney user group](http://www.meetup.com/en-AU/fsharpsydney/) and I decided to present on what I blogged about in my [last post](/posts/2016-10-10-learning-redux-with-reducks-beyond-javascript.html), implementing redux in F#.

You can catch the video of the talk [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8OmhCAZEH0).

Over the last few months I've been working with a number of the other Cloud Advocates at Microsoft to put together a video series that we've been wanting to do for a while now...

Introducing the **Beginners Series to: JavaScript**!

This is a 51 (!!) part series where we cover all the fundamentals of JavaScript, from setting up an environment to the language constructs to data types. You can read the [announcement post here](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2020/10/05/new-javascript-training-video-series-beginners/) but what you really want to do is watch the series, so [head over to YouTube](https://aka.ms/learnJS) and get learning!

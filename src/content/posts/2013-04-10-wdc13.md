I'm going to be speaking at the upcoming [Web Directions Code](http://code13.webdirections.org/#AaronPowell) in Melbourne (2nd & 3rd May) on the topic of IndexedDB. I'm pretty stoked to be invited to speak as there's a lot of heavy weights of the web development community that are going to be around and I'll finally have a chance to crack out my IndexedDB talk to a larger audience.

So do yourself a favor, grab a ticket and come on down!

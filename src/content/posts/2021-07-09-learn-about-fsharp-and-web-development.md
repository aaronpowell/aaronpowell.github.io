Every week my colleague [Cecil Philips](https://twitter.com/cecilphillips) hosts [On .NET Live](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oV2fcY7wsQHx4RNWXEDKgm4), an hour of live streaming about all things .NET.

He invited me on this week to talk about F# and web development, specifically how we can do serverless web development with F# and Azure Functions. This was a chance for me to show off some of the awesome community projects such as [Fable](https://fable.io) and [Feliz](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/), which make it easy to build client-side JavaScript applications, but done using F#.

We talked about how to created [Azure Functions with F#]({{<ref "/posts/2020-01-13-creating-azure-functions-in-fsharp.md">}}), I showed how you can get started using [some GitHub repo templates]({{<ref "/posts/2021-07-09-creating-static-web-apps-with-fsharp-and-fable.md">}}) to simplify a dev environment using Fable + Functions, and we finished by looking at an [app I build](https://github.com/aaronpowell/ondotnet-fsharp-complete) using this stack and [have deployed to Static Web Apps](https://black-glacier-08edf5f10.azurestaticapps.net/).

Check out the session on the [dotnet YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/dotnet).

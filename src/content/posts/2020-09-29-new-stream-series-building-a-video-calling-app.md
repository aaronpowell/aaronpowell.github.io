Last week at Microsoft Ignite there was a new service announced, [Azure Communication Services (ACS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/build-rich-communication-experiences-at-scale-with-azure-communication-services/?{{<cda>}}).

ACS is, essentially, the Teams backend for video, chat, telephone and SMS, but as a service you can integrate into your own applications.

So I decided that I wanted to check it out and as such I'm going to be doing a weekly stream where we look to build an app using ACS and also look at how we can integrate ACS with other parts of Azure (I'm particularly interested to play with Cognitive Services and ACS).

For this series though, I'm not going to stream primarily on my Twitch channel, but on the [Microsoft Developer Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/microsoftdeveloper), as well as our [LearnTV platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/tv/?{{<cda>}}). The videos will also be available on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT1QtGr1IzVPNSF_YMrKCAw).

We'll be kicking off at **2pm AEST, Wednesday 30th September** (which is 9pm the previous day in PST).

See you on the stream!

You've likely heard the news by now but Microsoft Build, aka `#MSBuild`, is going to be a virtual event streaming live for 48 hours straight!

{{< tweet 1256003038118129665 >}}

As an Australian, this is particularly exciting for me because it means that for the first time I can watch sessions live **and** jump into the Q&A with the presenter, rather than just watching a recording after the fact. We'll be able to participate in the sessions without having to get up at 2am!

While there's going to be many amazing sessions from our product team that you can jump in and watch, the fact that it's a live event means that we can do a lot of other fun things. One such thing is [Sonia Cuff](https://soniacuff.com/) and I get to host the APAC News Desk in which we'll be streaming for 2 days straight with interviews, panel sessions and demos with some of the folks who work on our products as well as people across our amazing community of MVP's.

We've even got a crazy studio setup in the Sydney Microsoft Reactor (Sonia will be in the Microsoft Brisbane office, keep up that social distancing 😉)!

You can find the full schedule of the News Desk on the [agenda list](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions?t=%257B%2522from%2522%253A%25222020-05-20T10%253A00%253A00%252B10%253A00%2522%252C%2522to%2522%253A%25222020-05-22T17%253A30%253A00%252B10%253A00%2522%257D&f=%255B%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522Build%2520Live%2522%252C%2522facetName%2522%253A%2522sessionType%2522%257D%255D) and if you [register](https://register.build.microsoft.com/) you can add them to your personalised agenda and even get calendar invites so you don't miss them!

I'm also going to be delivering two sessions, one on [How to be super productive with Node.js and Visual Studio Code](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/0f743b92-55fd-4c51-8ac5-bc30b56e07e1?source=speakerdetail) and another on [Remote Development with Visual Studio Code](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/98051ab8-b26e-4582-9215-5d21f2b18afd?source=speakerdetail).

So go, [register](https://register.build.microsoft.com/) your **free ticket**, tweet us what your home office looks like, your pets (`#PetsOfBuild`), and anything else that gives us an insight into how you're enjoying the online experience of Build this year. And hey, your tweet might even get featured on our stream!

We can't wait to see you on the stream. 😁

A few weeks ago I sat down with [Damian Brady](https://twitter.com/damovisa) (in our respective home offices ðŸ˜‚) to talk about [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/?{{<cda>}}) for the [DevOps Lab show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ikyViYMM69joIAv7dlMsA).

Check out the session, with demo failures and all!

_No really, we didn't mean for the build to be broken, but it worked well!_

People would probably agree that I'm not the most normal of people when it comes to developing software. Quite often something takes my fancy, and I have a crack at building with it, whether it is a good idea or not.

Recently there's been a lot of fuss on Twitter about a Ruby project which has recently gone into v1.0 called [Sinatra][1]. It's got a rather nice syntax if you're trying to build a quick-fire application, here's the `Hello World` example from the site:

    require 'sinatra'
    get '/hi' do
      "Hello World!"
    end

In fact in about 15 minutes I threw together a new site for some quick linking at [slace.biz][2], from which you can jump to [/umbraco][3] or get some basic contact info via [/me][4].

# Having fun with NodeJS

It's no secret that I'm a fan of JavaScript, especially if I want to do something that's a little... strange.

So after playing with Sinatra for a bit I decided "Why can't I just built it in JavaScript?". Oh sure, [it's been done before][5], but reinventing wheels are fun.

This isn't really a serious attempt, it's just a bit of fun and a bit of a learning experiment, so I decided that taking the piss would be the best way to go about it. To do this I decided to create my own framework, a framework inspired by a Danish 'musician' called Ole Erling.

The source code is available on my bitbucket, [if you want to grab it it's here][6].

# Design of Ole

The design of Ole is to be a fun one (remember: piss-take!) and to work with it you have a fluent API which you can work with. The first thing that `Ole` must do is enter the room (well, the file):

    var ole = requires('./src/ole').enters();

Now that `Ole` is in the room you can get him to do things, such as listen to HTTP events:

    ole.hears('GET', '/', function(req, res) {
      res.end('Hello World!');
    });

What I've said is that when `Ole` hears a `GET` HTTP request on the URL `/` it will execute a particular function. `Ole` can hear all four HTTP request modes, GET/ POST/ PUT and DELETE, it's up to you how you want to implement them.

Once you're said what `Ole` can hear you better get him to play it set:

    ole.play();

Currently `Ole` will only play on port 2009 (spot the in-joke there :P) on localhost.

# Conclusion

As I've said, this is a bit of a joke project that I'm working on, currently I'm hanging out to get a beta invite on [heroku.com][7]'s NodeJS support, or the [no.be][8] beta project, and when I do expect a site running `Ole` to go live :D.

Please feed free to get `Ole` running a set for you too ;).

Recently, we launched [a JavaScript beginner YouTube series]({{<ref "/posts/2020-10-13-want-to-learn-javascript-weve-got-a-series-for-you.md">}}) and now it's time for another new series...

**Beginners Series to: Node.js**!

In this free, 26 part video series, we'll cover everything from setting up a Node project to working with the file system, to setting up APIs with Express and debugging with VS Code.

You can check it out on [Channel9](https://aka.ms/NodeBeginnerSeries) or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHje-_287YJKhY8tDeSItwtg).

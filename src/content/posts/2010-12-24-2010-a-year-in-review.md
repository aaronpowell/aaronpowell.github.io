Well it's about that time of the year, the time when you look back at the year that was... and what a year 2010 has been.

Last year I said that [2009 was my biggest year professionally][1], but in reality 2010 trumped it well and truly.

## 2010, the year of the conference

In 2010 I set a new goal for myself and that was to become more of a figure in the Australian development community, and I started this off with a dive into the conference circuit.

I...

* Kicked off with [DDD Melbourne][2] where I presented a Beginning Umbraco session
* I then headed back to Melbourne for Remix (which I just attended :P)
* Flew to Denmark for [CodeGarden 10 to speak about unit testing][3]
* Returned to Sydney to help organize (and speak at) the first DDD Sydney conference
* Spoke about [Umbraco in the CMS Smackdown][4] for [SBTUG][5]
* Won Amped and went to Tokyo for Web Directions East
* Spoke about open source content management at CodeCamp OZ 
* Talked about [Open Conference Protocol][6] at the [Sydney Architecture User Group][7]
* And wrapped up the year with a lightning talk at [SydJs][8] on [JavaScript frameworks][9].

Phew, busy conference set, wonder if I can top that next year :P.

## Another year, another job

Last year I was excited about taking a new job with TheFARM Digital and getting to work with [Shannon][10] so we could really go crazy with Umbraco development. Well there was some sadness when I [announced that I was to be leaving TheFARM][11] to join [Readify][12].

## Open Source work

I spent a lot of time this year working on Open Source projects. Obviously Umbraco has featured highly in this area, with version 5 underway (and helping with the team migrate to Mercurial) a lot of my time was devoted there.

But I've also worked on a few other smaller projects:

 * [FunnelWeb][13]
  * A blogging engine targeted at real developers
 * [JavaScript tools][14]
 * [Ole][15]
 * [Slidee][16]
 * [WhatKey.Net][17]
 * [Examine][18]
 * [LINQ to Umbraco Extensions][19]
  * I'll update this soon :P
 * [Dynamic extensions][20]
 * [Open Conference Protocol][21]

Nice little list I think ;)


----------

Well that pretty much concludes my 2010 wrap up, in 2011 be sure to look out for me at MIX 11, DDD Sydney and CodeGarden 11 :D

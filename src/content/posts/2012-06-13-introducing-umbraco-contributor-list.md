# TL;DR

Want to be involved in driving the Umbraco Open Source project, join the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/umbraco-dev).

# All the details

One of the things that has come out of the Umbraco retreat this year is that as a community we need to get more involved in the direction of the open source project. This has always been something that many people has wanted to do but the problem has been *how* do you get involved.

For many years there has been the Umbraco Core but no one was really sure about what it was and who really was involved. This lead to a limitation with getting the community excited and involved in working on the product of Umbraco itself as we often took the attitude of *the core has it under control*.

Well it's time to change that, and in doing so I'm announcing the start of the Umbraco developer mailing list, which is running on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/umbraco-dev).

With this we need to get a few things clear though:

* This is a mailing list for discussing the **open source project** and not the usage of Umbraco; if you have a question about the usage of Umbraco then **please** use the excellent community site, [our.umbraco.org](http://our.umbraco.org). The moderators will close threads that are of this nature and redirect you to the appropriate forum
* Anyone can join. Got a question about the direction of the project this is the place to ask, got a feature to propose this is the place to discuss it, want to know how to get involved in submitting patches then ask it here
* Make sure you search before you ask, maybe someone else had that idea so check out their discussion
* This is the friendly CMS so remember to be an adult and play nice, the moderators will tell you off if you're being out of line

## What does this mean for the Core?

So you may be wondering what is the Core now? Well the goals of the Core haven't changed, they were always about driving the Umbraco project but now we're trying to make it easier for anyone to consider themselves part of the process. Ultimately the Core is the ones who have final say, they'll be committing the code, managing the mailing list, handling pull requests and that kind of stuff.

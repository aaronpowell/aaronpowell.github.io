Recently I was invited by the organisers of [GraphQL Summit 2021](https://summit.graphql.com) to be part of a panel about the State of Serverless.

I joined the delightful [Natalie Davis](https://twitter.com/codeFreedomRitr) and [Sunil Pai](https://twitter.com/threepointone), and we had the awesome MC, [Ivonne Roberts](https://twitter.com/ivlo11). It was a great bit of fun, we talked about some really interesting things and I even had Zoom crash on me during the session ðŸ¤£!

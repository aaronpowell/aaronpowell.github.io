With .NET 5 being launched and a multi-day event covering all things new, it's easy to get lost trying to wade through all of the announcements.

But don't stress, I'll be covering off the 5 things I think are most exciting from the launch at [Devs Speak](https://aka.ms/devsspeak) on the 20th Nov (5pm - 7pm ADST).

Grab yourself a ticket and join me and a bunch of awesome folks from around APAC to learn all things .NET.

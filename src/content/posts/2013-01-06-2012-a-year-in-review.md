It's about that time again but I'm a bit delayed in getting it done, it's time for a year in review!

Backing up from the busy year that was [2011](https://www.aaron-powell.com/2011-a-year-in-review) I...

* Kept my MVP and got to go to the MVP summit in Seattle
* Went to the first [Codemania](http://codemania.co.nz/) in NZ to hang out with some of the guys in the NZ dev community
* Had first [Pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com/training) course on [JavaScript design patterns](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/javascript-design-patterns) was published
* [Played the hipster dev](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9397363/Talks/2012%20-%20All%20you%20need%20is%20a%20browser/index.html#title) for my DDD Melbourne talk this year, taking about developing everything in the browser, which was based off a [similar talk](http://whatdoyouknow.webdirections.org/videos/hosted-all-the-things) from [Web Directions What Do You Know](http://whatdoyouknow.webdirections.org)
* Released my [first Windows 8 application](https://www.aaron-powell.com/pinboard-for-win8) which needs some serious TLC, damn lack of free time :(
* Made a surprise appearance at CodeGarden 12, [helped killed Umbraco 5](https://www.aaron-powell.com/umbraco/i-helped-kill-umbraco-5), [pointed out that MVC has always been possible with Umbraco](https://www.aaron-powell.com/umbraco/using-mvc-in-umbraco-4) and once again [encouraged people to get involved in Umbraco](https://www.aaron-powell.com/umbraco/introducing-umbraco-contributor-list) which has been going really well since then
* Stepped out of my comfort zone and [did some XAML](https://www.aaron-powell.com/xaml/xaml-by-a-web-guy) but I'm still unconvinced by it
* [Presented at Teched again, this time on Win8 app dev with HTML and JavaScript](https://www.aaron-powell.com/speaking/teched-2012) where I was kind of just ranting :P
* Dived into [IndexedDB](https://www.aaron-powell.com/tagged/indexeddb) and released [a wrapper library called db.js](https://www.aaron-powell.com/web/hello-dbjs) to deal with some of the shitty API points
* Played with TypeScript, the Microsoft answer to "the JavaScript problem". My blog about using [source maps for TypeScript](https://www.aaron-powell.com/web/typescript-source-maps) was by far my most popular post
* Got engaged and bought a house (cuz you know, sometimes I get off the computer...)

It's been a bit quieter than in the past few years, but a much more maintainable a pace I think. Now to prepare for 2013...

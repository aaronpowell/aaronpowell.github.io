Recently I was invited by the lovely (? :P) people of [SydJs][1] to come down as participate in their lightning talks night. I presented on the topic of JavaScript frameworks (although to this day I'm not really sure what my session title was as [Craig Sharkie][2] introduced it as something rather random).

The basic point of my talk was just to give some pointers to people who are looking to create reusable JavaScript components, resulting in me converting some JavaScript which what running my slides into a small library which anyone can use (links below).

All in all I really enjoyed being there, it was my first time down there (not only at SydJs but at a non-.NET user group, the enemy is a bit scary :P) and hopefully they will allow me back in the door in the future!

Here's the obligatory links set from the talk:

 - [Slides][3]
 - [Slidee (which was running the slides in the browser)][4]
 - [WhatKey.net][5] ([source][6], [launch blog][7])
 - [My JavaScript tools][8] (contains the namespace method, mocking frameworks, etc)
 - [LINQ in JavaScript][9]

It's possibly old news but I only just found out today, the recording of my [Unit Testing with Umbraco][1] session from [CodeGarden 10][2] is available online for viewing.

Apparently the audio isn't great, but I'm sure you can get the gist of it ;).

[The video is available here][3], and while you're at it check out the other [CodeGarden 10 session videos][4].

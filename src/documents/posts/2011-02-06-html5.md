When I first wrote [LINQ in JavaScript][1] a few years ago it was just a thought experiment.

Since then I've actually found that I want to use it, quite often in fact, and a lot of the reason I've been wanting this is because I'm lacking the ECMAScript 5 features which LINQ in JavaScript provides.

# ECMAScript 5 quick primer

A lot of people mistake many of the ECMAScript 5 (ES5) features for being HTML5, but it isn't really, what we're looking at here are the next features of JavaScript, and these are the `map`/`filter` methods.

These methods are similar to the kind of things you expect in functional programming languages, and how you can interact with arrays. The [IE9 Test Drive][2] actually has a good set of [examples of using these new features][3].

So now that browsers are starting to come with built in methods like `Array.prototype.map`, which will transform the data into a new type or `Array.prototype.filter`, allowing us to conditionally remove items from the array, it'd make sense to actually use them.

# Improving LINQ in JavaScript

As I said browsers are starting to ship with the new features on Array they are going to be a lot faster than anything written purely in JavaScript and residing in-browser.

Let's for example look at improving the `Array.where` method:

	Array.prototype.where = Array.prototype.filter || function (fn) {
		//implement a custom method
	}

Here what we're doing is executing the logic of:

 * If the `Array.prototype.filter` method exists assign it to `Array.prototype.where`
 * If it doesn't we'll provide a custom method

We can do the same thing with `select` and `indexOf`, using built-in methods from the `Array.prototype` chain.

# Other updates

While adding these updates I also decided to do some other performance tweaks:

 * `skip` will now use `Array.prototype.slice` rather than iterating through the collection in JavaScript
 * `take` also uses `slice`, but does a -1 multiplication so we go backwards through the collection
 * `groupBy` has been cleaned up so there's a few less lines of code in it
 * `select` and `where` will pass in all the ES5 arguments when running in browsers that don't support ES5

Feel free to [check out the code from my bitbucket][4], and maybe some others than I will use it ;).

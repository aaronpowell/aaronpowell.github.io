---

Today there was an exciting announcement from the IE Dev relations team, the team behind [IE Dev Chat](http://twitter.com/iedevchat) and [modern.IE](http://modern.ie). At Build they announced a new website to help developers track progress of features, [status.modern.ie](http://status.modern.ie/).

This website is similar to the [Chrome Status](http://www.chromestatus.com/features) dashboard where web developers can get an insight into what is happening with feature development.

Through status.modern.ie we can see what features the IE team is considering or has under development already, or features that are currently not being pursued.

For example we can see they are developing [cross-domain font loading](http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/) or that the [Battery Status API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/default/battery/Overview.html) is something that they are considering. You can also see what version a particular feature dropped in IE along with links to the relevant documentation.

As a web developer and someone who is passionate about IE it's create to see the IE team starting to become more open in their progress, giving us an insight into what features they are considering for upcoming versions of IE. Hopefully  this is a sign of changes to come and IE team continues down the path of being more open with what their road map is.


So go check out [status.modern.ie](http://status.modern.ie) and if you've got in feedback get in contact with myself or ping [@IEDevChat](http://twitter.com/iedevchat) on twitter.

As you have probably seen we at [TheFarm require a senior .NET developer][1], and there is a some-what sad reason for this... I've decided to move on from TheFarm.

I've taken a job with one of Australia's top .NET consulting agencies, [Readify][2]. I'm really excited about having the opportunity to work with some of Australia's best .NET developers, and I'm really quite excited about this chance.

I do feel sad about leaving TheFarm though, I've had an awesome 12 months working with Shannon, I've learnt a shit load and made a great set of friends. And if you're looking for a new job (or you're thinking of moving to Australia) I'd recommend talking to the guys at TheFarm.

## What about Umbraco?

When I took the job with TheFarm last year one of the main drives was to have the chance to work closer with Shannon on Umbraco (and producing the AUSPAC Mafia!) and moving on does not mean that I'm becoming less involved with Umbraco.

In fact, it's the opposite really. Something that I've found being a core team member and an Umbraco user was that I often had to make a choice between the two. Anyone looking at codeplex will have seen my check-in's drop off, and that was a lot to do with working every day with Umbraco, I was finding it hard to then come how and work on the core product as well. My new role is less Umbraco focused which is going to free up my desire to work on Umbraco more.

And with v5 kicking along I'm really excited to get back into hard-core Umbraco core development.

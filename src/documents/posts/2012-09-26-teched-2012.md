Couldn't make it to Teched Australia this year?

Made it and absolutely loved my session?

Well good news everybody, it's now online for your viewing pleasure, [check it out here][1].

This year my session was looking at doing Windows 8 applications using HTML and JavaScript. Through the session I looked at things that I learnt while building [my application][2], things that you need to watch out for and stuff that just plain sucks.

Hopefully it helps you avoid grief in your on WinJS applications.

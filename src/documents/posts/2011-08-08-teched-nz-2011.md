Because if you are you can see me not once, not twice, but three time, and really, who wouldn't want to see me that much :P.

Come down to [COS204 - Umbraco and Azure][1] to learn about how awesome Umbraco is and how it really does love Azure.

Or if web is more your thing jump on over to [WUX202 - Chasing the Evolving Web][2] to learn about being a modern web developer and [WUX203 - JavaScript Pitfalls for the .NET Developer][3] to learn about common problems encountered when doing JavaScript development and how to avoid them.

See you in Auckland!

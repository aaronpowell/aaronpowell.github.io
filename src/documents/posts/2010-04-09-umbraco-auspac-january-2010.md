First off I'd like to say thanks to all who attended tonights Umbraco webinar, I think we had mid 20's for most of the session, really excited by the volume.

Anyone who hasn't already filled out the [post-session review][1] please do so, it'll help me make it more awesome next time ;).

As promised, here are the resources from tonights session:

* [Slide Deck][2]
* [.NET project][3]

For those who are interested I did record tonights session, but it appears that it stopped recording about 20 minutes before the end. The majority of the video can be found [here for your viewing pleasure][4].

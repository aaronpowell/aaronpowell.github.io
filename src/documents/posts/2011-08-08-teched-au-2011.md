Because if you are you get to see me not once but twice! Woot!

Come down and check out [WEB203 - Chasing the Evolving Web][1] and learn how to keep ahead of the game when it comes to doing the latest and greatest on the web.

In addition you should come to [DEV305 - An MMO in 45 Minutes: Developing for 2 screens and a cloud without being cut][2] for some utter bedlam with myself, [Luke Drumm][3], [Richard Banks][4] and [Steve Nagy][5].

See you there!
